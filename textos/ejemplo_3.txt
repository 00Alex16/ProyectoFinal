I’ll keep this simple. The game is shallow, tedious and broken. Don’t get sucked in by the shiny visuals. The people giving this high scores obviously haven’t played very much of the game nor have they encountered the many gamebreaking bugs.

The combat is tedious and clunky, the loot is boring, there are only three areas in the game and they all play the same. There is no mission variety, in fact when free roaming any world all you do is activate a beacon that leads to 3 garbage puzzles and once you finish them, the game doesn't give you anything else to do except warp back to the main hub so you can reload to the same area to do the same thing again for little reward.

At the the time of this review there are several major bugs that make the game unplayable. These vary from not letting you attack enemies, to not being able to open chests and collect resources to being permanently unable to complete the free roam beacons.

There is some potential here and with a lot of work, this could be a decent game. At present this game is not ready for prime time and was rushed to release. Avoid.
